# Word-Builder-App
The initial goal was to creat and deploy the app on heroku, but then realised my account is no longer free there. I ended up playing around with MS Azure and Google cloud but they were denying me access, something to do with firewall settings. I was hoping to not have to upload it as a bland project on git but rather send links to running projects but hey.
